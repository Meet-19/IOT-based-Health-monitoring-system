The health monitoring system comprises a pulse-oxy sensor, a temperature sensor, and a WiFi module based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The sensors collect data from the user, which is then analyzed by the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 microcontroller then sends the analyzed data to the cloud, where it can be accessed and retrieved. Additionally, the data can be displayed on an OLED screen. Overall, this system provides comprehensive monitoring of a userâ€™s health in real time using advanced technology.
